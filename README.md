# Transparent Theme
### (See original base before fork - https://github.com/CapnKitten/Translucence)

This is a simple fork that mainly changes the settings to my liking and removes the background wallpaper to allow for transpareny fully

```

## Main Changes:

- No more message boxes
- There is no background, it partially transparent (customiseable in config) by default
- Accent Colour changes
- Reply ping dimmed
- Padding between messages decreased

The changes in the config file have comments around them, so you can pick out the ones you like!
